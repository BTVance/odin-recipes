    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare your work area: Lay out all your ingredients and have them ready. If you're using any optional toppings, prep them and set them aside.</li>
    
    <li>Heat a skillet: Place a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Let it warm up while you prepare the quesadilla.</li>
    
    <li>Assemble the quesadilla:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Place one tortilla on a clean surface.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle half of the shredded cheese evenly over the entire tortilla.</li>
        <li>If you're using any optional toppings, scatter them over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Top with the remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the second tortilla on top to create a sandwich.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Cook the quesadilla</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Lightly grease the heated skillet with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the assembled quesadilla to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 2-3 minutes on one side, or until it turns golden brown and the cheese starts to melt.</li>
        <li> and cook the other side:</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, carefully flip the quesadilla to the other side.</li>
        <li>Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the second side is golden brown, and the cheese is fully melted.</li>
        <li>Check for doneness: Make sure the cheese is fully melted and the tortillas are crispy and golden brown.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Slice and serve:
        <ul>
        <li>Remove the quesadilla from the skillet and let it cool for a minute.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to slice it into wedges or triangles.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Serve:
    
    Serve your quesadilla with sides of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream if desired.
