    <p> Making a classic American snack is a relatively simple process. The greatest American hero Joey Chestnut can probably cook them faster than he can eat them! Here's a recipe to make this American classic.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot dog sausages</li>
        <li>Hot dog buns</li>
        <li>Condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, etc.) </li>
        <li>Toppings (sliced onions, pickles, sauerkraut, shredded cheese, etc.) </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Preheat the Grill or Stovetop:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>You can cook hot dogs on a grill, stovetop, or even in the microwave. Preheat your chosen method.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Prepare the Hot Dogs: </h3>
<ol>
    <li>You can cook hot dogs straight from the packaging, or you can make a few shallow cuts along the length of each sausage. This helps them cook more evenly and prevents them from splitting open.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cook the Hot Dogs</h2>
<ul>
<li> (Prefered Method) Grill: Place the hot dogs on the grill over medium-high heat. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally until they're heated through and have grill marks. </li>
<li>Stovetop: Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add a little oil if desired. Place the hot dogs in the pan and cook for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally until they're heated through and have a slight sear. </li>
<li>Microwave: Place the hot dogs on a microwave-safe plate and cook on high for 1-2 minutes, or according to the package instructions.</li>
<li>Prepare the Buns: While the hot dogs are cooking, you can lightly toast the hot dog buns on the grill, stovetop, or in a toaster. This step is optional but adds a nice texture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assemble the Hot Dogs: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place a cooked hot dog in each bun. Add your choice of condiments and toppings. Common choices include ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, sliced onions, pickles, sauerkraut, and shredded cheese. Customize your hot dog to your taste!</li>

    <li>Serve: Hot dogs are best served immediately while they're still hot.</li>

    <li>Feel free to get creative with your hot dogs by trying different combinations of condiments and toppings. The classic American hot dog is just a starting point for your culinary adventures!</li>
